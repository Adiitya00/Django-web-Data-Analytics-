# Django-web-Data-Analytics-
using Django and python for Data Analysis operations for CSV File Data
This Django web application allows users to upload CSV files, perform data analysis using pandas and numpy, and visualize the results on a web interface.
## Features
### File Upload: 
Users can upload CSV files using a simple web form.
### Data Analysis: 
Basic data analysis tasks include displaying the first few rows of data, calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation), and handling missing values.
### Data Visualization: 
Generates basic plots (histograms) using matplotlib integrated with pandas.
### User Interface: 
A user-friendly interface using Django templates to display analysis results and visualizations.
# Data Analysis
Data analysis involves examining raw data with the purpose of drawing conclusions about the information. It typically involves several steps:

### Data Cleaning:
Removing or correcting inaccurate data, handling missing values, and transforming data into a usable format.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Investigating patterns, trends, and relationships in the data using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and summarization techniques.

### Statistical Analysis: 
Applying statistical methods to understand the significance of observations, relationships, and patterns identified during EDA.

### Predictive Modeling: 
Using machine learning and statistical models to predict outcomes based on historical data.
# Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. It uses visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps to make complex data more accessible and understandable. The main goals of data visualization are:

### Representation: 
To visually represent data and information clearly and effectively.

### Exploration:
To enable exploration of data patterns and relationships.

### Communication: 
To communicate insights and findings effectively to stakeholders.
# Usage
## 1.Upload a CSV file

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload_file/ in your browser.
Choose a CSV file from your local system and click "Upload".
You'll be redirected to Analysis_result.
## 2.Process the uploaded file

1)showing the analysis_result page.
2)The first few rows of the uploaded data.
3)Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.
6)Histograms for numerical columns displaying data distribution.

# commands:-
### 1)Clone the repository
### 2)Set up a virtual environment
        a) python -m venv env 
        b)`env\Scripts\activate`
### 3)Database migrations
          python manage.py migrate
### 4) Run the development server
            python manage.py runserver
### Providing CSV file For testing
        SampleWeatherData.csv
## Providing Python File 
         This file is created using only Python and Python libraries, not using Django. 
         Due to the difficulty of opening the main project file, you can use this file instead. 
         It is simple to use: open any compiler and run it.
